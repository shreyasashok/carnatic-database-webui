<h2>About</h2>

<strong>Carnatic Archive Version 1.0.0</strong>
<p>
This database is meant for Surya sir's sishyakulam. The goal is to be able to easily find kutcheri recordings of songs to learn from. The recordings will be mainly from Surya sir's concerts, but will include some other various concerts as well. 
<br /><br />
This database is NOT meant for general consumption. Many of these recordings are not of high enough audio quality to be shared with the general public. Therefore, please do NOT share the links to this site or any videos it links to outside the sishyakulam.

<strong>FAQ</strong>
<br />
Q: Is there mobile phone support? <br />
A: Not at the moment. The website may look bad/not work properly on phones right now. When I get time, I will try to optimize the mobile experience, but it might be a while. <br />
<br />
Q: When will new concerts be uploaded? <br />
A: Whenever I can find time to do it. The process is largely automated, but each concert needs to be split up into individual tracks, labeled, and uploaded, which takes some time. <br />
<br />
Q: I found a mistake: how do I report it? <br />
A: Click the green info button to the left, and then click the report mistake button. I will fix it when I get time. <br />
<br />
Q: Why can I only play 50 videos at a time?<br />
A: This is due to YouTube playlist limitations and I don't know how to fix that right now.<br />
<br />
Q: Is this website bug-free?<br />
A: Probably not. If you find bugs, please email me at shreyas.ashok1@gmail.com.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I download the songs as well?<br />
A: Due to the costs of cloud storage, I cannot host all the recordings on the web. You are free to use YouTube downloaders to download from the linked videos, though.<br />
<br />
Q: Can you implement a new feature?<br />
A: Maybe. Email me at shreyas.ashok1@gmail.com and if it's not too hard to add, I may be able to do it.<br />
<br />
Q: What do A, N, and S stand for in the krithi table?<br />
